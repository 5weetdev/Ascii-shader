# Ascii shader for minecraft

Inspired by Acerola's video on ASCII art rendering, this shader project aims to recreate the iconic Minecraft visual style using ASCII characters. By translating the game's visuals into ASCII art, the shader produces a unique and nostalgic aesthetic.
## Features:
- ASCII Rendering: Converts the Minecraft world into a grid of ASCII characters.
- Bitmap Font Texture: Utilizes a bitmap font texture to map characters onto the screen.
- Color and Black & White Modes: Supports both colored and black & white rendering modes.
- Edge Detection: Integrates edge detection techniques for enhanced visual detail.
